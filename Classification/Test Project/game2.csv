It is similar to card game Spades played in Western world. The objective of the game is to score the highest points of all as well as to stop other players from getting higher points by breaking their call (Hence the name ""Call Break""). The points are accumulated in the form of hands. Hand is same as trick in Spades. After the cards are dealt, players make call (bid) in the range of 1-13 hands that they expect to capture based on their cards. Players with several high cards and high number of spades would make a higher call than a player with mostly low cards and less spades cards. The cards are ranked form highest to lowest in the usual way (Ace being the highest and 2 being the lowest). Spades, as said earlier is higher ranked suit. Players try to play trick on other players to make them loose their higher cards. After playing five rounds, a player is declared winner with the highest points.\nIn this version, you will play with three intelligent robot players devised to simulate real-time players. Their playing strategy can be preset from game settings. The app also keeps records of player\'s score and other important statistics.

We discovered it at the famous USATE Tournament, brought it home, and it has become a favorite game at home, and among chess fans at our local chess club\u2026.\u201d\n\n2)  Becca, 12 year old student writes\u2026\n\u201cMy family and i love plunderchess!! it is the best ever!! we\'re always playing it! I used 2 dread it when my family played chess bc 2 me it was boring. but PLUNDERchess, now thats another story. its easy to understand and FUN!\u201d\n\nHere are a few of the BASIC Rules of PlunderChess\xae Play:\n1) ""Plundering"" occurs when a chess piece captures an opposing piece and ""plunders"" or ""acquires"" additional moving capabilities directly from the piece it just captured, hence, strengthening the capturing piece!  This plundering is illustrated by the overlaying of a colored banner (called ""vests"") on the piece that made the capture.  Image illustrations provided.\n\n2) The added moving capability provided by a plundered vest may be used one time only on any future move.  (I.e., the plundered vest may be used on it\'s very next move or carried around on the board and used later in the game, but only once.)\n\n3) Plundering is optional and may be declined by the player making the capture.  YES, sometimes you do NOT want to plunder a vest from the spoils of the kill!!  The case for NOT plundering would be if you suspect your opponent will immediately capture you back (making a ""trade"") and acquire the vest you just plundered!  (See rule #9)\n\n4) When plundering is elected, a ""colored vest banner"" that corresponds to the moving capabilities being plundered, gets overlaid upon the chess piece that made the kill.  This vest banner signifies to both players that the piece wearing it now has extra moving capabilities for one future move.","White Horse Games, LLC",4+,EN,29162496,Games,"Games, Board, Entertainment, Strategy",18/02/2014,4/3/2016,High

All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We\u2019re avid Catan players ourselves. We\u2019ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program.

New challenges added via the cloud and player rivalries will keep this game on the home screen of your iOS device. \n\nFrom Ed Anderson, the creator of ""ZDAY Survival Simulator"", ""Survivor Z"" is a text-based Role Playing Game set 311 days after the ZDAY apocalypse has wiped out 90% of the world\'s population.  Gameplay begins with an exciting strategy-based prologue, where the player has to make it home to the safety of their ZDAY bunker.  Then, fast forward almost a year, running low on food and water, our survivor is forced to emerge, only to find that the world has changed.  The population is decimated, and the dead roam the earth in incredible numbers.  Every decision a survivor makes can be the difference between life and death, and even the most seemingly trivial mistake can mean doom.\n\nExcellent Player resources and help from the developers can be found on player forums:  http://forums.mongadillo.com\n\nGameplay in Survivor Z expands on the concept of its predecessor, ""ZDAY Survival Simulator"".  While relying on the familiar text based model, Survivor Z introduces a vastly improved and incredibly robust game engine that gives the survivor complete control over their weapons, inventory, and armor.  In addition, players can use their items in context to complete challenges, as well as find an ally with non-player character survivors in the game.   \n\nSurvivor Z is the first game of its kind, combining the intellectual challenge of a text based RPG with the fast paced action of a board game.  But Survivor Z doesn\'t stop there, in addition to being a very entertaining adventure game, Survivor Z adds another dimension by utilizing cloud based game content that will continually provide survivors with new updates and challenges, and uses location based services to transform the landscape around the survivor into the post apocalyptic world of Survivor Z.\n\nSurvivors will find real world location challenges like the Newark Cinema in Delaware, Restaurants in Portland, Oregon, and even the Buddy Holly museum in Lubbock Texas to name just a few, as well as hundreds of other challenges that can be found in any town in the country.  Everyday coffee shops, fast food restaurants, hardware stores and malls are all transformed to become the backdrops for survivor strongholds, hidden troves of weapons and supplies, and dangerous traps set by rival survivors.  No matter where you go when you are playing Survivor Z, you are in the realm of the undead, and no place is safe.  \n\nOnce the player has fought through the fictional game content, the real work begins.  The player can search real world locations to find new challenges, unlock new stories, and try and build strongholds to protect against attacks from the undead and rival survivors.  Players fight to take and hold onto territory and resources as they struggle to survive.  The more your influence grows, the more powerful you will become.  Scavenge for supplies, craft fortifications and traps to protect your interests.  It you against the world.  \n\n**Note: This game requires an internet connection to play, and location services to be enabled.",Mongadillo Studios Inc.,12+,EN,57778176,Games,"Games, Role Playing, Entertainment, Strategy",10/2/2013,13/06/2015,Intermediate

Levels become more complex by changing the direction of the orbits, speeding up, slowing down and adding other variations and obstacles.  More difficult levels give you a little help by allowing you to shoot balls out of the way with special shooting stars, and allowing you to earn bonuses  (extra shooting stars and spare lives which allow you to continue after having a ball collision). \n\nIf you love games, this is a great one to add to your library and challenge yourself to advance as high as you can through the levels.

In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.\n\nPartia 2 : The Pretenders War is a sequel to Partia: The Broken Lineage. The game packs 22 stages that could present challenges to any SRPG fan.\n\nPartia 2 introduces many new features, including the choice of ""Common turn"" rule where all factions make moves alternatively (like Chess) instead of taking turns to move all his/her units. I believe this will bring a new nuance to gameplay if a player choose to do so. It can be toggled in intermission, and you can always play the game in the traditional FE way. (Common turn idea is from Berwick Saga) AI had improved a lot, and horse units now can move after attacking, if they have remaining move distances. \n\nRegrettably, the game could not deliver large animation battle. If you felt the game looked bad in Partia 1, then you\'ll find this game look much the same, except we have much bigger and nicer character portraits. It is because original Partia was never profitable, making Partia 2 production running on fume. (It sold around 6000 copies in two years) The stress of not getting paid almost broke our team of two, but somehow sheer will allowed this game to be out here for you. So whether this game series is success or not, I am immensely proud of the results. How many five year projects can a person do in a life time? ;-) Many times I was tempted to include some IAP stuff into the game and get cheap dollar or two, but I decided against it. More than anything, I rather have this game to be remembered as good, than have that IAP distaste.\n\nSo you may refrain from purchasing this game if you didn\'t like Partia 1. But I promise you it will be a much better experience (and much more challenging) if you did enjoy the original Partia.\n\nThank you all, and please let us know what you think!",Imago Software,9+,EN,79221760,Games,"Games, Strategy, Role Playing, Entertainment",22/10/2014,24/06/2018,High

Once designed for high-pressure environments and exploring gas giants and deep space, these mechs have now been modified for war. \n\nTemplars descend from a Zendu bloodline -- a unique heritage that gives them the ability (with proper training and ritual) to pass all of memories from their lives (and any memories passed down by their ancestors) to a newborn child. This memory gift is known as a Templar\u2019s Lineage \u2013 and it is what gives Templars their immense advantage in combat, tactics, engineering, and the ability to drive hulking Leviathan Battle Suits. You will take the role of a Templar Captain who hails from a storied Lineage reaching back 87 Templars -- and who pages back through the memories to help cope with the dire situation at hand.\n\nWith the Great Exodus coming to an end, the Star Traders founded new colonies on the few remaining habitable worlds. The Templar Knights are called upon once again to defend the Star Traders and their new colonies from an ancient threat.\n\n= WHO WE ARE =\nTrese Brothers Games is a premier indie game developer of desktop and mobile RPG and strategy games.

What if 2016 had gone differently, if perhaps your candidate had had a bit more money, been a better candidate, or just been a bit luckier? What if someone else had run? What if a third party candidate had just as much money to spend? Or maybe even significantly more? What could you do with a hundred million dollars? A billion? Ten billion? What if there were four competitive parties? How would that change things? What if there were no established parties running at all?\n\nWith Election Manager 2016 you can answer those questions and more... Try running an election on a shoestring or with an unfair advantage. Run as a Democrat or Republican, manage the Libertarian or Green ticket, or go completely independent. Let your adviser make all your decisions for you, or micromanage every decision yourself, or anything in-between. The choices are all up to you.\n\nAbout the Game:\n\nElection Manager 2016 is an abstract strategic election simulation game where you manage your ticket in an attempt to get your candidate elected to the office of President of the United States. Election Manager comes with a variety of scenarios, from a recreation of the 2012 election to a four-way election between independent parties. In addition, almost any imaginable two-to-four way election scenario can be designed by the player.\n\nThe Election Manager 2016 engine uses actual historical and demographic data to produce reasonable election results, taking into account factors such as partisan lean and voter elasticity. The player will not only have to consider states but also media markets, giving the game a strategic dimension due the inefficient mapping from one to the other. For instance, to target New Jersey's 14 electoral votes, the player would have to spend money on ads in the Philadelphia or New York City markets \u2014 but significant portions of those markets are actually in other states. So is it really worth spending that money there, or would it be better spent going after other states instead?\n\nWhile Election Manager aims to give you complete control of your strategy, it also comes with tools to help you manage it \u2014 up to and including an AI campaign manager to which you can delegate any part (or all) of your strategy, from campaign stops to ad buys to state offices to polling. Game features include:\n\n\u2022 Completely customizable scenarios, including pre-built 2012 and hypothetical 2016 scenarios\n\u2022 Scenarios for two to four parties\n\u2022 Run a Democratic ticket, a Republican ticket, or any number of third-party or independent tickets\n\u2022 Single player or hotseat multiplayer\n\u2022 Set up campaign and fundraising stops for your candidate\n\u2022 Plan your ad strategy for every market in the United States\n\u2022 Use ads to attack your opponent, or boost your campaign with positive ads\n\u2022 Set up campaign offices in battleground states\n\u2022 Handle everything yourself, delegate everything to your AI campaign advisor, or anything in-between\n\u2022 Tools to help you plan your polling or ad campaigns or budgeting\n\u2022 Data and maps and lots of it""",Lensflare Games LLC,4+,EN,63550464,Games,"Games, Education, Strategy",18/11/2014,10/11/2016,High

A game lasts from 20min (beginner board) to 3 hours (expert board).\n\nEach player controls from one to four ""survivors"", human beings in a zombie-infested town. In fact, ""survivors"" hastily change to ""hunters"" to smash zombies through and through. However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide\'s going on, the ""Danger level"" is going up and the infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster.\nZombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between ""beat\'em up"" and ""survival horror"" as characters keep on turning from prey to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest.\n\nThe Zombicide Companion App serves as a digital replacement for the Survival Identity Cards used in the boardgame to keep track of each character\u2019s equipment inventory, experience and skills. But the app goes beyond that, offering players some cool extra aids as well.\n\n\u2013 Features \u2013 \n\u2022 A virtual deck of equipment cards allows you to easily control you survivors inventory, switching cards around with a flick of the wrist and no fear of cards slipping around.\n\n\u2022 Keeping track of your survivor\u2019s experience has never been easier. Add XP by ticking off what zombies you killed and your Danger Bar is automatically updated.\n\n\u2022 As you gain experience and new Danger Levels, your new Skill options are automatically displayed, and the app incorporates any pertinent new game effects.\n\n\u2022 Having a hard time keeping track of your actions as you gain new free ones? With the Action Bar, you can tick off each specific action as you take it, so you always know what actions you have left.\n\n\u2022 Roll virtual dice for any of your equipped weapons, automatically calculating successful hits according to any combat skills you may have (and with sound effects to boot!)\n\n\u2022 Choose any of the Survivor characters, including the promos. Up to 6 Survivors can be managed on the same device.\n\nGuillotine Games\nhttp://guillotinegames.com",CMON,12+,EN,337832960,Games,"Games, Board, Reference, Strategy",12/9/2012,13/03/2019,Intermediate

If you\'re not familiar with the rules of Mahjong Solitaire game, the this app is a good introduction, because this app is easy to play. The difficulty level of this app is for all levels, although most of the levels are for ""beginner"" to ""intermediate."" The easy levels (boards layout) are fairly simple, the stacks of tiles are short and the number of tiles to match are not overwhelming.\n\nThe rules of the game is simple:\n- You are presented with the game board, containing stacked tiles, forming structures such as the so-called ""pyramid"" or ""turtle"" solitaire board, tower-like stacks and others. \n- To win the game, all the tiles much be removed from the board by matching them.\n- Tiles can be matched if they have the same face/picture, under the condition that the tile is not blocked. \nA tile is not blocked if it can slide to the left, right, or both, and there\'s no tiles above it.\n- You lose the game when the board has not been cleared and there\'s no more tiles that can be moved.\n\nSounds simple? Then start playing. But prepare for some challenges, because Mahjong Solitaire is an easy to learn game that can be hard to master. You need to think ahead and chose which tiles to match carefully. Sometime the best move is the one that will free more matching tiles and not the most obvious ones. Sometime you\'ll just have to try your luck because the tile underneath the matching tile is blocked. \n\nAs mentioned, it can be challenging not to not end up with tile(s) that are not ""free,"" which cause the board to be in an unsolvable state (dead-end). This can occur when all the matching tiles are covered by other tiles or if they can\'t be moved because there\'s a tile blocking its sides or covering above it.\n\nFeatures:\n- Colorful Easter eggs themed variations of popular Solitaire Mahjong game. Instead of matching numbers and bamboos and dragons, you\'re matching pictures of painted Easter eggs.\n- Contains many boards for beginners and casual players alike.\n- The boards are for various Mahjongg skill levels, beginners to intermediate. The traditional/classic turtle/pyramid board tower is included. \n- Easy touch interface, just tap a tile then that another tile that matched it.\n- Hint option to highlight matching Mahjongg tiles (if there\'s a match possible).\n- Shuffle options to assist when reaching a dead end. This will ""free"" some of the previously blocked tiles. But use sparingly because the number of Shuffles is limited.\n- Cheerful graphics and soothing background music.\n- Every board (level) is generated with a special algorithm. No game is ever the same; and even though your moves may make a board unsolvable, every board starts with a solvable configuration.\n\nWorks on phone and tablets.

Using the unique tabletop interface, you can select games with 2, 3, or 4 players in them. You can add computer/AI players as needed.\n \nMost importantly, because of the nature of the game, people of mixed skill levels can enjoy playing together. You don\u2019t need to be a chess star to have fun with Warlord Chess. In a 4-player free-for-all, the best player does not necessarily win!\n \nThat is a crazy looking board...\nThat\u2019s true! It needed to be to fit 4 full armies. Plus, it allowed us to add special spaces that make for some incredible moves.\n \nThe Chaos Symbol: the symbol in the center of the board gives a special move to Pawns, Kings, and Knights. If one of those pieces begins its move from one of the spaces touched by the symbol \u2013 then they can begin their move *from* any one of those spaces. This helps the Pawn and King a bit\u2026but it works wonders for the Knight. Don\u2019t believe us? Just look at the screenshots below!\n \nThe Castle: each player begins with their army surrounding their castle. A castle is made up of three spaces known as The Throne, the Great Hall, and the Courtyard. These spaces enhance the way the Bishop, Rook, and Queen move. Beware the Queen in the Courtyard!\n \nBut I\u2019m Just Learning/No Good at Chess/Easily Confused...\nThen we have the *perfect* chess game for you. The interface was designed for everyone. Just touch a piece to see all the moves it can possibly make. Then tap the space you want it to move to. If you don\u2019t like it you can Cancel that move and try another. When you are sure of your move, you can press a button to Confirm it.\n \nIf you need practice, play a local game against a single opponent and set the AI to Easy. Increase the difficulty and number of players as you get better. You can even play team games and learn from your partner. There are so many options!\n \nWhat Have You Got For Us Experienced Players?\nWe\u2019ve got a lot. If you are *very* familiar with chess, then Warlord Chess will provide you with a brand new challenge. It is nearly impossible to control a board this big, especially against 3 players who are out to get you. So good luck with that. You can set the AI to \u201cHard\u201d in order to play against opponents that can see multiple moves ahead.\n \nWe\u2019ve also provided you with tools for analyzing your Warlord Chess games. You can save and load up to five games. With our Rewind, Forward, Start, and End buttons you can move through those games step-by-step so you can figure out why you lost, brainstorm some killer new moves, or relive past glories.\n \nWhat Else Have You Got?\nWe\u2019ve got a board that hovers and rotates over a roaring field of flame. We\u2019ve got special attacks for each of the four colors in the game. We\u2019ve got Secret Passages and a cool scoring system. And we\u2019ve got more on the way.

Should the punishment always fit the crime, or do some people deserve to be made an example of? Are you a straight laced crime fighter threatening the freedom of hardened criminals, or are a cold-blooded killer, waxing j-walkers and speeding drivers? With Vigilante 3, that decision is left with you. Be part of the problem, or the solution.\n\nThere are hundreds of unique NPC stories to investigate, and our NPC Story Generator lets you create in-game scenarios based on your own experiences. Ever been bullied? Threatened by a bill collector? Harassed by a rookie cop? Virtual revenge is available!  By creating your own story arc, you not only get to decide who deserves your brand of justice, but also what form it comes in. Choose your punishments - From a simple threat, mark, or black eye to something more stringent like a stabbing, robbery, or killing. You can see your stories manifested in game where you'll get the chance to take control of the situation. Wanted to give that guy that cut you off a beating? Not only can you get that opportunity, but you can observe how other players react under the same circumstances.

The Honey Badger Bee is an agressive territorial predator. It attacks its prey in swarms, has a stinger that can grow 1 to 2 meters long, and has the ability to convert red meat into honey.  \n\nIf the Honey Badger Bee doesn\'t end Chiron\'s journey then the Predamantis will.  The Predamantis is nature\'s perfect predetor.  It\'s stealthy and uses a cloaking mechanism to blend in with the environment.  The predamantis attacks relentlessly in packs and eats its prey alive.

Rack the balls with a powerful break shot. Impress your friends your billiard playing skill! You don\u2019t have to buy an expensive pool table just to enjoy fun and addictive pool party with your friends. Just download our app and play for FREE! \n\nDo you love to play billiard? Have you ever dreamed of becoming a biliard or snooker master, playing bilyard on a pool live tour across the country? Maybe you even dream of participating in the World Pool Championship. To become a maestro, you must practice and play against tough opponents to sharpen your snooker skill. The problem is, like most people, you probably don\u2019t have access to a pool table 24/7.  However, you can still practice your skills by playing virtual 8ball pool on your iOS device. You can practice with your friends or random players who also enjoy playing snoker as much as you do. \n\nSome people like to play 9 ball pool and some people enjoy 8ball pool games. In Pool with Friends, the game you can play is the 8 ball pool version. The rule of the game is slightly different than the 9 ball version. For example, in the 8ball version, you may not put the opponent\u2019s balls into the pockets. By playing this game, you will be able to practice and learn about the rules of the game easily. \n\n=============================================================\nTOP FEATURES OF POOL WITH FRIENDS \u2013 EIGHT BALL POOL MULTIPLAYER: \n=============================================================\n\n#MULTIPLAYER BILLIARD GAME\n\nPlay with your friends offline or play with random players online.  You can also play against yourself to practice your shots.   \n\n#REALISTIC 3D SIMULATOR\n\nPool with Friends uses an advanced and realistic physic simulator. You will see how the balls move on the pool table when you hit the ball with different strength and direction. Enjoy playing as if you are pool billiards pro.   \n\n#BEAUTIFUL AND REALISTIC GRAPHIC\n\nWe handcrafted the game graphic to make it look realistic and sharp. The graphic will help you determine how to make the best and most accurate shot. \n\n#LEARN ABOUT THE RULES OF THE GAME WHILE PLAYING\n\nAfter your turn, we will check the table and inform you if you\u2019ve committed a foul. We will also inform you the name of the foul. For example Scratch is a foul when a player pockets the white ball. As the result, the opponent can choose where to place the white ball. This is a great way to memorize the rule of the 8 ball pool game. \n\n#SMOOTH GAMEPLAY AND GAME CONTROL\n\nTo play this game, first tap on the table to place the ball to rack. Then adjust the direction and the strength. Tap on the Hit button to hit the white ball. It\u2019s a very easy and straightforward gameplay, but it\u2019s not easy to master. You need to practice to understand the physic of the game and how the ball moves when you hit using certain level of strength to a certain direction.\n\nPlay pool (8 Ball) with your friends around the world.\nUsing turn based multiplayer, you can have multiple games going at the same time. Requires GameCenter and internet to play.\nFeaturing realistic physics, great graphics, standard rules, fun gameplay and highscores.\nWarning: Quitting the game after you hit the white ball and before your turn is over will result in a loss.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?

Now is the time to step up as Commander-in-Chief, look at the big picture, plan for your fleet formation and design your very own tactics to beat your enemies in enormous-scale space battles. In the world of Over Space it is not uncommon to get involved in massive space encounters featuring over 100 spaceships, a scale never before seen on any mobile games.\n\n\n# # # Create your own fleet formations and tactics\n\nGood reflexes might be what counts most in one-on-one space combats, but you certainly need a little more than that when it comes to massive fleet to fleet space battles.\n\nDesign your very own fleet formation that suits your style. Get the best out of the armory your Tank Frigates offer, send in some agile Speeder Destroyers here and there to roam around and distract the enemy spacecrafts, or rely on the long attack range of your Ranger Cruisers. Mix and match among different spaceship classes.

Put your best tactics to the test and see how they fare against fellow fleet commanders. It's no longer just about the raw power of the battleships. You might as well outclass your opponents with your unique formation and superior tactics. In fact, in Over Space you get even better rewarded when you deploy a relatively weaker fleet to defeat a stronger opponent by means of some outstanding strategies and tactics.\n\n\n# # # Unlimited ship / crew combinations, endless tactical possibilities\n\nCorvettes and Frigates are good. Destroyers and Cruisers are better. Yet nothing beats your own customized battleships with your self-created unique extension modules. \n\nYour tactical options don't just stop there though. As you scout around and recruit some great talents they provide you with further opportunities to customize the way your battleships perform.

PLAY NUMBERS NO ONE ELSE IS PLAYING\u203c Smarter Quick Pick is designed to find you those numbers. It eliminates common patterns people use\u2014such as dates\u2014giving you confidence you won\'t be sharing your prize!\n\nImagine - you wait your whole life for that big lottery jackpot. You finally win, and guess what? You have to share your prize with other winners! Can\'t be avoided, right? Actually, yes it can!\n\nThe first thing to understand when playing the lottery is that every ticket has the same chance of winning. Yes, even 1-2-3-4-5*6! I know this sounds crazy, but there was actually a lottery drawing in Germany that came up 2-3-4-5-6*26. And guess what happened? Over 38,000 people had to split that jackpot!\n\nThat\'s when it hit me: People have systems for picking lottery numbers, and if I can avoid those patterns, I can drastically increase my odds of not having to share the winnings!\n\nHave you ever wondered why so many lottery jackpots have multiple winners, while so many other drawings have no winners at all? You\'ve probably seen it many times: big jackpot, millions of players, and no one wins. Drawing after drawing, no winners. And the jackpot grows and grows. Then finally one drawing has 2...3...sometimes even 5 winners - all at once! Why is that??\n\nThe secret is in the drawings that had no winners. If you look at those numbers, you will see something amazing - no patterns! No dates, no anniversaries - nothing in particular that would have made someone want to use those numbers. These are the types of numbers you want to play!!\n\nWe have analyzed these patterns and designed ""Smarter Quick Pick"" specifically to avoid them. ""Smarter Quick Pick"" will give you numbers to play that have a low liklihood of being played by others. After all, why would you play numbers that other people are playing??\n\nYou may be wondering why you need this app when lotteries already have ""Quick Pick""... Well, you should never use a lottery\'s built-in ""Quick Pick""\u203c Here are two very good reasons why:\n\n\u25b6 Reason #1: You may actually be increasing your odds of having to share! Computers cannot generate random numbers on their own - they need a starting point (or \u201cseed\u201d) number \u2013 and most of them use the time of day. Quick Picks are generated on the spot by the local lottery terminal. These terminals operate independently, using the current date & time to help them decide what your ""random"" numbers will be. With potentially hundreds of other people buying tickets at that moment across the region, the chances of getting the same numbers as someone else go up.\n\n\u25b6 Reason #2: Quick Picks do not eliminate numbers and patterns people use often. You want to play random numbers, yes \u2013 but only to a point. You also want to eliminate sets of numbers and patterns that people commonly use. Standard ""Quick Pick"" does not do this for you. ""Smarter Quick Pick"" does!\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Works for all major lotteries around the world\u203c\n\u2022 Utilizes online atmospheric noise data to calculate random numbers\n\u2022 Will very likely never display the same numbers twice\u203c",Baby Toga Software,12+,"EN, DE, SE, ES",11223040,Games,"Games, Entertainment, Strategy, Casino",14/08/2013,14/08/2013,Intermediate

Enter your favorite systems from books, update them as you like with trends in Grandmaster games, and revise your lines between rounds at your next tournament.

Find what works for you and out-prepare your opponents!\n\nRepertoire Features:\n  * Enter opening variations and specify key moves you want to play.\n  * Provide alternative moves for when you choose to vary your lines.\n  * Name your openings for refined training.\n  * Easily expose gaps in your repertoire.\n  * Build lines for White and Black without switching contexts.\n  * Record annotations (!, ??, ?!, etc.) and take notes.\n  * Import/Export PGN files via iTunes or email.\n\nTraining Features:\n  * Take random quizzes from your repertoire or filter for specific lines.\n  * Train black, white, or both sides.\n  * Repeat failed quizzes until you get them right.\n  * Jump to the repertoire screen to review forgotten answers.\n  * Find your best and worst results sorted by percentage correct.\n  * Identify opening weaknesses for further study.\n\n** Don\u2019t be caught off guard at the board.  The best time to prepare is before the game! **\n\nFill Chess Arsenal with your favorite openings and all their side-lines.  Tell it which response you would play in a tournament.  These moves come from your own research, not the app, so you are building a truly personalized opening repertoire.  Improve your organization by naming openings.  These can be chess names (\u201cSicilian Defense\u201d) or custom groups (\u201cBob\u2019s Opening\u201d); it\u2019s up to you!\n\nDo you have a standard response to 1. e4, but change it against a particular player?  Enter both moves into your repertoire and add a comment to explain the alternative.\n\nSwitch to training mode and your openings are played back until a key position is reached.  Do you remember the move you prepared?  Train against your entire database or focus on specific openings by using the quiz filter.\n\nIdentify openings to study by reviewing your training results.  Feeling confident with certain moves?  Tell Chess Arsenal to skip them while training and focus on more challenging lines.\n\n* PGN Import/Export *\n\nChess Arsenal supports the popular Portable Game Notation (PGN) format used by most chess software.  Import PGN files via iTunes or choose \u201cOpen in Chess Arsenal\u201d within other apps.  These can replace or be merged into your repertoire.  Export your repertoire to PGN via email attachment or iTunes (drag and drop files with Apps->File Sharing->Chess Arsenal).

Abalone has been one of the best games around for nearly 30 years, known for its hexagonal board and black and white marbles. The goal of this abstract board game is simple: push your opponent\u2019s marbles off the board! But beware, it\u2019s not easy to master, so keep your wits about you and rise to the challenge! \n\nHAVE A PLAN OF ATTACK... \n\nCreate a plan of attack to push your opponent\u2019s marbles off the board. On every turn, you can move one space in any direction with 1, 2, or 3 lined-up marbles. When you\u2019re in a Sumito position (that is, when your marbles both outnumber and are in contact with your opponent\u2019s) you can push their marbles out! For example, you need three black marbles to push one or two white marbles. There\u2019s no use in rushing; it\u2019s better to take your time and think of every possibility since one hasty move can put you in a bad position and let victory slip through your fingers. \n\n...AND HAVE A STRONG DEFENSE.\n\nIf you want to win, the key is not to attack, but rather to take specific positions with certain combinations of moves. Just like in chess and checkers, you can try to create traps by sacrificing marbles or strategic positions to block your opponent. The most dangerous contact points are at the edges of the board, where a bad move means losing a marble or the whole game! Sometimes, it\u2019s better to be patient if you want to win! \n\nDON\u2019T CONFUSE FORESIGHT AND HASTE \n\nThe keys to victory are looking ahead and analyzing your opponent\u2019s play. Although the game is easy to learn, it requires strategy and thought. To hone your strategic thinking, the game offers several modes that let you review your games play by play. For example, Challenge Mode helps you become a true Abalone master, one move at a time. The challenges get harder as you advance. For example, at first you must push out a single marble only to win a challenge, then two, and the master will get progressively tougher.\n \nPLAY ALONE OR WITH FRIENDS \n\nPlay alone against the computer with Challenge Mode and Free Play Mode, or play against your friends. With Pass & Play Mode, you can duel on the same device! Tired of playing your friends?

Each player tries to win a fight for the nest by surrounding a small defenseless chick with their various bird soldiers - while trying to protect their own.\n\nHow to win?\n\nVictory can only be achieved in one way. You have to surround the enemy\u2019s chicken from all six sides of these hexagons. No matter if it\u2019s surrounded by soldiers of only one team or both - the only important thing is the absolute encirclement on all sides! Which means the immediate victory of a player whose chicken will find at least one free field around itself.\n\nBasic rules\no. Players alternate after each move. You can either cast a new stone or move with already deployed one.\no. The first stone of the starting player belongs to the centre of the battlefield. The first stone of the second player must be placed on the touch of the opponent's first stone.\no. Each newly deployed stone (except the first stone) must only be attached to one's own existing stones and must not touch any opposing ones.\no. Until you deploy the chick (in the third or fourth move), players are only allowed to cast stones, not to move with them. From then on, you can move your stone in one of the ways described below, at your discretion to win the game!\no. All stones must be connected to each other with at least one side, therefore creating a nest. Any move that would violate this rule is not possible (except for one exception - falcon).\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\xdavod\nJedn\xe1 se o strategickou hru pro 2 hr\xe1\u010de, kter\xe1 m\u016f\u017ee vzd\xe1len\u011b p\u0159ipom\xednat \u0161achy.

The levels are filled with dirt which can be tunneled through simply by moving through it. This creates empty space. Emerald and diamonds can be collected by moving into them. Diamonds are with 3x as Emeralds.  Rocks and gems can rest on dirt, walls (only indestructible and magic walls), or other rocks and gems, but once these are removed, they will fall down. This is sometimes useful, as you can drop things on top of monsters roaming the levels. Some destroyed monsters drop gems necessary to achieve the necessary number to complete the level.  Or they may drop other pieces, such as explosives or keys to help you solve the puzzles.  Or control the wind direction.  There are dozens of creatures to interact with.
